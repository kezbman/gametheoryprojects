This is my final project for the Game Theory course at Isfahan University of Technology. It consists of two separate parts: Stable Matching, and Top Trading Cycle.
Basically, Stable Matching is the process of matching n women with m men where men are proposing to women accroding to their preference list one by one; and there shouldn't exist a man and woman that prefer eachother but are not together in a relationship. Obviously, The algorithm is not just for matching men and women and can be implemented for many purposes.

Top Trading cycle is the process of trading a specific type of object in a group of n people where Each one of them owns one of the objects, and has a preference list that indicates which item they would prefer to have. The algorithm forms a graph with players as vertices and connects vertice i to vertice j with an arrow which means player i prefers the object that belongs to person j to the one that belongs to him/her.
